Praise Story is a custom-built Laravel application that helps Christians document and share their testimonies online.

Built with **Livewire**, the app allows users to:

- Submit testimonies through a secure form
- Format content using a **Markdown editor**
- Control visibility (e.g., public, private, draft)
- Track ownership and status using **UUID-based routing**
- Enable admin approval and editing flows

The app follows Laravel best practices for authentication, authorization, and clean code structure. It’s deployed on **DigitalOcean** via **Laravel Forge** for performance and security.

Whether you're a believer looking to share what Jesus has done in your life or a ministry curating stories of faith, Praise Story offers a platform that’s simple, elegant, and purpose-driven.

Explore the live demo and discover how faith can be shared—one story at a time.
