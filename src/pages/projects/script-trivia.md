I developed this project to support my passion for opening the minds of non-IT professionals to the world of IT--namely coding. In this age of technology, it is essential to understand the apps they use. It is NOT the aim of this app to convert people into programmers.

This app is built in `ReactJS`, `Typescript` & `SASS`. It is compiled using my custom `Webpack` boilerplate. This app lacks a backend, so I avoid paying for a database. The quiz data is baked into the code. This means a rebuild when new quizzes are added.

The app does not store or track one's progress to avoid legal implications. This means that if one closes the page, their progress will be lost.
