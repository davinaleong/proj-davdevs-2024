The idea for this project came about when I was figuring out how to showcase all the original jokes and riddles I came up with. Currently, I store them Google Docs. But I wanted to create a generator which shows a random joke. It will also have a button for users to view another joke without refreshing the screen.

There were 2 parts to this project: the jokes API and the interface. The jokes API was built by extending [Davina's CMS](https://www.davina-devs.com/projects/davinas-cms). It includes a route that pulls a random joke.

Initially, I built the interface as a separate HTML, CSS & JS project, but was unable to resolve the cross-origin errors. So I decided to built it into Davina's CMS. It uses the blade template & CSS to load the interface, and uses JavaScript to load the joke from the random joke API route.
