This riddles catalogue extends from my general one, [Laugh and be Blessed](https://laugh-and-be-blessed-next.vercel.app/). This catalogue contains riddles about the train station names in Singapore. Mass Rapid Riddles is a play on the name of Singapore's subway system, Mass Rapid Transit.

Click on the cards to see the riddle. I've added a hint feature to this project. Click on the "Hint" and "Answer" to toggle these sections, respectively.

This project was built in Astro and used Contentful to store the riddles. It is hosted on Netlify.

Hope this website will help you to learn more about Singapore's subway stations üòÅ.
