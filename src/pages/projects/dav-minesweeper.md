Welcome to **Dav/Minesweeper**, my take on the classic Minesweeper game that was bundled with Windows 95! This project was a great learning experience, and I had a lot of help with the game logic from multiple AI tools.

It all started as a coding challenge at a local tech meetup on **25th January 2025**, where I built a **terminal-based version** of Minesweeper using **Node.js and Jest**, focusing on writing testable code. You can check out that version [here](https://github.com/davinaleong/proj-minesweeper-terminal).

Wanting to push myself further, I decided to create a **playable UI version**. With AI's help, I set up **Webpack and React**, but I soon realized that adapting a terminal-based game into an interactive UI was more cumbersome than I expected. Instead of forcing a conversion, I **started fresh**, prioritizing a fun and engaging user experience.

This UI version is built with **React and Tailwind CSS**, using **Vite** for bundling and **GitHub** for version control. It is deployed on **Netlify**, making it easily accessible to everyone.

This project has been both a technical and creative challenge, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it! ðŸš€
