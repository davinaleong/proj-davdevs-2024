`HTML` stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the structure of a webpage. You can identify HTML code by its angel brackets like this: `<p>Hello World</p>`; it looks similar to another coding language called Extensible Markup Language (XML): `<title>Dav/Davs</title>`.

It is the skeleton of every webpage. It tells the web browser what a heading (`<h1>`) or a paragraph (`<p>`) is. It does this through special codes called tags, for example: (`<span>`). There are two kinds of tags in HTML: paired and unpaired. Paired tags need an open tag: `<strong>` and a closing tag: `</strong>`, like this `<strong>Dav/Davs</strong>`. This code boldens the content between the text. At the same time, unpaired tags are self-closing like a horizontal rule: `<hr>`.

There are more advanced tags like `<video>` to embed video content and `<canvas>` to allow graphics to be drawn on a webpage.

Here's a sample html code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Dav/Devs</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Dav/Devs</h1>
    <p>My personal portfolio website</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
