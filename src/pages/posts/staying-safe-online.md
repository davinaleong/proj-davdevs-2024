Hi friends! It’s your friendly Christ-coder again 💻✝️

In this digital age—especially with AI advancing rapidly—it’s more important than ever to stay vigilant and safe online.

We need godly wisdom to discern truth from deception. It’s getting easier for bad actors to create fake profiles or use machines to impersonate real people. That’s why it’s essential to verify sources and check with those who know and love you before believing what you see or hear.

More than ever, this world shows us how much we need Jesus. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life—and we need His guidance to navigate the noise and confusion of the internet.

So let’s be wise, stay alert, and trust in Him to protect us—even online.
Amen? 🙌✨
