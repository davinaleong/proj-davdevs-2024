Hello, fellow followers, Did you know you can style your WhatsApp messages in bold or italicize them?

"But how do I do it?" you may ask.

You do it by typing special characters into your messages to stylize that portion of text or phrase. Where do you find these special characters? You see them by tapping the "123" key beside the "emoji" key. Then tap on the "#+=" key just above the "ABC" key to find these special characters.

For bold text, use the asterisk character (`\*`) like this: `\*I like cats\*`. The word "cats" will be bolded in WhatsApp. Note that the asterisk character is not shown when your text is sent.

For italicized text, use the underscore character (`_`) like this: I am `\_33 years old\_`. And the phrase "33 years old" will be italicized. Note that the underscore character is not shown when your text is sent.

For cancelled text, you will use an unfamiliar character called the tilde character (`~`). Example: I used to be `~32 years old~`. And the phrase "32 years old" will be cancelled. Note that the tilde character is not shown when your text is sent.

_Note:_ The screenshots are taken from an iPhone. Android users should seek assistance from their peers if they can't find the special characters.
