### Why do you need a VPN on your phone?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) on your phone helps keep your online activities private and secure. When you use a VPN, it creates a secure connection to the internet, hiding your data from potential snoopers like hackers and even your internet service provider. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi, like at a coffee shop or airport, where others can more easily access your information. A VPN can also help you access content that might be restricted in your region, giving you more freedom online. It's a tool to protect your privacy and ensure your internet usage remains safe.

### Why do you need a password manager on your phone?

A password manager on your phone helps you keep track of all your passwords securely and easily. Instead of remembering dozens of complex passwords for different apps and websites, a password manager stores them all in one safe place. It creates strong, unique passwords for each account, so if one gets hacked, the others remain safe. When you must log in to an app or website, the password manager can automatically fill in the correct password. This way, you don't have to remember or type out every password, making your online life more secure and convenient.

### Why do you need an authenticator app for two/multi-factor authentication?

An authenticator app on your phone adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts through two-factor or multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA). When you log in to an account, you'll need to enter not just your password but also a code generated by the authenticator app. This code changes every 30 seconds, making it impossible for hackers to guess. Even if someone steals your password, they can't get into your account without the code from your phone. This makes your accounts much more challenging to hack and keeps your personal information more secure.
