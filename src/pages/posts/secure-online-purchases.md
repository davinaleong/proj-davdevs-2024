Hello everyone!

Here's another tech tip for you allâ€”this time, it's about ensuring your online purchases are secure.

To do this, simply tap on the address bar of your web browser to reveal the full URL of the e-commerce website. Make sure the URL starts with "HTTPS". This indicates that the transaction between the website and the web server is secure. Never purchase goods or services from websites that do not start with "HTTPS".

For those who are curious or tech-savvy, "HTTPS" stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure". It's an enhanced version of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) that ensures secure communication over the internet by encrypting the data between the user's browser and the website. HTTPS protects sensitive information such as passwords and credit card details from being intercepted by hackers. Additionally, HTTPS verifies the authenticity of websites, ensuring you connect to legitimate sites and not fraudulent ones. Courtesy of ChatGPT.
