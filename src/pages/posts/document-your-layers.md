Here’s a tip for those with problems tracking all the z-indexes in their CSS files.

Document your z-indexes as a comment in your CSS/SASS files.

Here’s an example in SASS:

```
/// Layers

/*
0 - Default
1 - Primary Header, Dialog
2 - Mobile Menu
3 - Close Menu Button
4 -
*/
```

I hope this tip helps you as much as it helps me!
