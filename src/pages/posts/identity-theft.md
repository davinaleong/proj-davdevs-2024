Hey everyone,

Here is a quick tip to help prevent identity theft, inspired by something that happened to me recently. Luckily, I was paying attention and avoided getting scammed.

So, on July 18, I got a Facebook message from Leo Nzio, saying that Ophelia Moore was using my profile photo. After checking, I found out it was true and reported the profile.

But then Leo Nzio asked about pets and suggested we walk our dogs together at Orchard Road. I almost sent a photo of my dog but got suspicious and asked my parents for advice. I also tried to verify who Leo Nzio was since I knew someone with the same name who was a friend of a friend.

The next day, my friend received a friend request from the same Leo Nzio profile. I've told my close friends and family about it, and the profile using my photo has been removed.

Remember to always verify the identity of new online acquaintances before sharing any personal information. Stay sharp online, everyone!
