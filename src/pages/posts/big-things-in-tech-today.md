I just attended the CityJS Conference in Singapore yesterday. The big things in tech today are AI and Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is big, but AI is new. What is happening in AI is transforming what is happening in Cybersecurity today. I bumped into a few familiar and new faces yesterday.

It was a very eye-opening experience to see what is happening in JavaScript and, by extension, the tech space. I will leave it to professionals to summarise what was shared yesterday, but amongst them were running a Llama on your local machine, how to test a 2FA, accessibility, and how to monetise your website.
