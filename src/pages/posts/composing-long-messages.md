Hello, peeps. Hereâ€™s another tech tip from yours truly. This time, itâ€™s about composing long messages on the phone.

Need help finding the text box of your messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram too small for long messages?

Try composing them in your notes app first, then copy and paste them into your messaging app.

Hope this makes your messaging journey more enjoyable. Happy messaging ðŸ˜Š
