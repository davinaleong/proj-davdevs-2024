Hey everyone, it's Davina Leong with another tech tip! This time, let's talk about the various programming languages used in software development. It's important to note that you can't determine the programming language used to build software just by looking at it; only industry professionals can identify that.

Websites:

- Frontend (what you see and interact with): **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- Backend (behind-the-scenes processing): **PHP, Python, C#, Java**

iOS Apps: **Swift, Objective-C**

Android Apps: **Kotlin, Java**

Windows Programs: **C#, Java, C++, Visual Basic**

Mac Apps: **Swift, Objective-C**

Happy coding!
