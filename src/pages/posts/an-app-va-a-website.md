How do you tell the difference between an app or a website when viewed on your phone?

If you have to install it via App Store on iPhone or Play Store on an Android phone(Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, Sony, etc) then it is an app.

If the link opens up your Safari or Google Chrome on iPhone or Web Browser on or Google Chrome on an Android phone (Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, Sony, etc), then it is a website. Also if you see something like “www.website.com” at the top or bottom of your phone screen, it means you’re on a website.
