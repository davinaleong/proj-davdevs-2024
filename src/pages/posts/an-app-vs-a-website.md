Ever wondered how to tell the difference between an app and a website on your phone?

It's simple: If you had to download it from the App Store (for iPhone) or Play Store (for Android devices like Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, Sony), you're using an app.

But if you tap a link and it opens in Safari or Google Chrome on your iPhone, or in your web browser on an Android device, you're browsing a website. A quick tip: if you see something like "www.website.com" at the top or bottom of your screen, you're definitely on a website.
