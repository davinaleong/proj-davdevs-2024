HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language of the web. It's like the skeleton of a webpage, providing the structure and framework for content. HTML uses tags to define elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and images, creating a cohesive and organized layout. Think of HTML as the blueprint that browsers use to render websites, ensuring a standardized structure for displaying information. 🌐🏗️
