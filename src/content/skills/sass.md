Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor that enhances the styling capabilities of web development. It's like an assistant to CSS, introducing features like variables, nesting, and mixins. Sass simplifies and organizes stylesheets, making them more maintainable and scalable. Think of Sass as a powerful styling tool that streamlines the process of creating visually appealing and consistent designs for web applications. ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€
