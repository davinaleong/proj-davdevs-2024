React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's like the architect of modern web applications, providing a declarative and component-based approach to UI development. React enables developers to create interactive and scalable user interfaces efficiently. Think of React as the toolkit for building reusable UI components, making it easier to manage state, handle user interactions, and create dynamic web applications. ⚛️💻
