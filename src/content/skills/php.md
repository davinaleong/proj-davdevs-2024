PHP, or Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language powering dynamic web content. It's like the engine under the hood, processing requests and generating dynamic web pages. PHP seamlessly integrates with HTML, enabling developers to create interactive and data-driven websites. Think of PHP as the backend workhorse, handling tasks like form submissions, database interactions, and more. ðŸ’»ðŸ”§
