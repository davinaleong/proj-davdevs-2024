Vue is a popular JavaScript framework that helps developers build interactive websites and web apps more easily. Think of it like a set of tools that makes it simpler to create dynamic features—like updating content on a page without needing to reload it. It’s often compared to React, another framework, but many find Vue easier to learn because of its straightforward structure. Whether it's adding animations, handling user interactions, or displaying live data, Vue helps developers build modern, smooth web experiences with less hassle.
