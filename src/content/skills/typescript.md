TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing to the language. It's like a safety net for JavaScript developers, catching errors during development rather than runtime. TypeScript enhances code quality and readability, providing features like interfaces and type checking. Think of TypeScript as a tool that brings structure and predictability to JavaScript projects, making them more maintainable and scalable. 🚀⌨️
